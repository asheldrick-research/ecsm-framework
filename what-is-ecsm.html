<h1>What is ECSM?</h1>

<p>
The Emergent Condensate Superfluid Medium (ECSM) is a physical framework in which
gravitational, optical, and cosmological phenomena arise from the collective
dynamics of a coherent cosmic medium.
</p>

<h2>Core Principle</h2>

<p>
ECSM does not assume spacetime geometry as a fundamental input. Instead, effective
metric behaviour emerges as a limiting case of propagation through a medium with
finite coherence and relaxation time.
</p>

<h2>What ECSM Is Not</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Not a modification of General Relativity</li>
  <li>Not a dark matter or dark energy model</li>
  <li>Not an exotic particle proposal</li>
  <li>Not an expansion history reparameterisation</li>
</ul>

<h2>What ECSM Proposes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Gravity emerges from collective medium response</li>
  <li>Light propagation is coherence-dependent at finite scales</li>
  <li>Standard metric optics are recovered in the infinite-coherence limit</li>
  <li>Weak lensing can decorrelate from structure growth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Relation to Established Physics</h2>

<p>
ECSM reproduces standard gravitational lensing and cosmological optics in regimes
where coherence lengths are effectively infinite. Deviations appear only where
finite-response effects become relevant.
</p>

<h2>Scientific Status</h2>

<p>
ECSM is an active research framework. It makes quantitative, falsifiable predictions
and is intended to be tested against observational data rather than assumed correct.
