# ECSM Framework

**Emergent Condensate Superfluid Medium (ECSM)** is a theoretical framework in which
gravitational, optical, and cosmological phenomena arise from the collective dynamics
of a coherent cosmic medium, rather than from fundamental spacetime curvature or
dark-sector components.

In ECSM:
- Spacetime geometry is an **effective description** of condensate deformation.
- Gravity and inertia emerge from **universal coupling** to the medium.
- Electromagnetic propagation reflects **phase dynamics**, not quantized particles.
- Late-time cosmological observables can be reproduced **without dark matter or dark energy**.

The framework is developed through a sequence of analytical and phenomenological papers
that address ultraviolet completion, gravity, spacetime optics, and late-time structure
formation.

  *(gravity and equivalence from medium dynamics)*

- **Emergent Spacetime Optics from a Superfluid ECSM: Non-Metric Light Propagation, Weak Lensing Suppression, and CMB Phase-Transition Signatures**  
  *(light propagation and observational signatures)*

- **Separating Geometry, Growth, and Amplitude in Late-Time Cosmology: A Joint Analysis of BAO, RSD, Weak Lensing, and CMB Consistency**  
  *(late-time cosmological constraints without expansion)*

All papers are authored by **Adam Sheldrick** and are publicly available.

## Scope and Status

ECSM is an active research program.
It does **not** claim to replace ΛCDM phenomenology in all regimes at present, but provides
a unified physical ontology that reproduces key gravitational, optical, and cosmological
observations without invoking additional dark components.

Feedback, critique, and independent analysis are welcome.
